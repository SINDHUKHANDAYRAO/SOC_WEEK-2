## 9. Understanding SoC Design Fundamentals & BabySoCâ€™s Role

Designing a System on a Chip (SoC) is like building a **tiny city on a single piece of silicon** â€” where each block (CPU, memory, I/O, GPU, DSP, etc.) works together seamlessly. SoC design fundamentals involve understanding how to integrate diverse components efficiently while balancing **performance, power, and area constraints**. This requires skills in **hardware architecture, circuit design, physical layout, and verification**, along with careful planning of interfaces between modules. The goal is to create a compact yet powerful chip that can handle complex tasks without consuming excessive power â€” much like fitting an entire computer, entertainment system, and power grid into a microchip.

BabySoC serves as a **hands-on introduction to the world of SoC design**, bridging theory with practice. By integrating a RISC-V CPU, a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), and a 10-bit DAC on a single chip, it gives students a real-life example of an SoC. BabySoC not only demonstrates digital logic and processor design but also shows how digital systems connect with the analog world. Imagine a student building a tiny music player on a chip â€” where their code running on the RVMYTH CPU directly controls sound output to a speaker through the DAC â€” thatâ€™s the power of BabySoC in action.
