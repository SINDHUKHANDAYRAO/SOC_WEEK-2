# ðŸ“˜ My SoC Journey â€” Week 2

This repository captures my journey of **understanding System-on-Chip (SoC) fundamentals** and performing hands-on lab work.  
It serves as both a personal learning diary and a documentation of practical experiments.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The main objective of this journey is to:

- Build a solid understanding of **SoC fundamentals**  
- Apply theoretical knowledge to practical lab exercises  
- Develop functional modelling skills using simulation tools  
- Learn how to work with the **VSDBabySoC project**

---

## ðŸ“š Theory Reference

The theoretical foundation for this journey is documented here:  
[THEORY/SOC.md](THEORY/SOC.md)  

It covers:
- SoC architecture and components  
- Basics of functional modelling  
- Simulation workflows using Icarus Verilog & GTKWave

---

## ðŸ›  Lab Work

All lab-related experiments, steps, and results are documented here:  
[LAB/lab.md](LAB/lab.md)

The lab work includes:
- Understanding VSDBabySoC  
- Writing and simulating Verilog modules  
- Observing waveforms and verifying results  
- Applying theory in practical scenarios
